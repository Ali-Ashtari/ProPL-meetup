# Bayesian Machine Learning - Reasoning under uncertainty with Edward

We roughly worked through some of the problems outlined
[here](https://github.com/UnataInc/PyCon2017#outline). The
[PyCon2017](https://github.com/UnataInc/PyCon2017) repository has much greater
detail; during the coding session we restricted ourselves to the reduced problem
set that you see in [current folder](./).

## Setup guide
Please follow the instructions outlined
[here](https://github.com/UnataInc/PyCon2017#software-setup).
