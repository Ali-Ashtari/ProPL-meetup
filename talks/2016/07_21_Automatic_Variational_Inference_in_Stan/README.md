# Automatic Variational Inference in Stan

This talk/discussion is centered around
[the more recent version of the paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00788) on
Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference. The
[original paper from 2015](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03431) did not elaborate
quite as much as some of us found the 2016 version (titled "Automatic
Differentiation Variational Inferenve") more accessible.
