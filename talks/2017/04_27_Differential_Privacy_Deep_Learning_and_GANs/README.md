# Differential Privacy, Deep Learning and GANs

This was a
[joint session](https://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Differential-Privacy-Meetup/events/239329011/)
with the
[Toronto Differential Privacy Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Differential-Privacy-Meetup/). The
paper presented an architecture to conduct differentially private machine
learning and demonstrated the ability of GANs (and more generally
semi-supervised techniques) to get state-of-the-art results in the
privacy-accuracy tradeoff.

*NOTE*: given the well-known
 [Accuracy paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_paradox), it would be
 interesting to see how the results change in the face of different metrics.
